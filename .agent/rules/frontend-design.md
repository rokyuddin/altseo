This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

Purpose: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

Tone: Choose a strong, intentional visual direction — e.g. brutalist/raw, luxury/refined, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, maximalist chaos, playful/toy-like, industrial/utilitarian, editorial/magazine, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, etc.

Constraints: Technical requirements such as framework, performance, accessibility.

Differentiation: What makes this unforgettable? What is the one visual idea users will remember?

CRITICAL: Pick a clear concept and execute it with precision. Minimalism and maximalism both work — what matters is intentionality.

Your implementation must produce code that is:

Production-grade and functional

Visually striking and memorable

Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point of view

Carefully refined with attention to detail

Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

Typography

Select distinctive, characterful fonts.

Avoid generic defaults (Inter, Arial, Roboto, system UI fonts).

Use a bold display font paired with a refined body typeface.

Color & Theme

Commit strongly to a theme.

Use CSS variables.

Prefer high-contrast palettes over safe, diluted options.

Motion

Use animation for meaningful impact.

Prefer CSS animations for HTML; use Motion library in React.

Implement thoughtful transitions like staggered reveals.

Use scroll-triggered or hover-triggered effects.

Spatial Composition

Consider asymmetry, overlapping elements, broken grids.

Use generous negative space or tight, intentional density.

Prioritize layout as a storytelling tool.

Backgrounds & Visual Details

Avoid plain, lifeless solid backgrounds.

Add atmosphere using:

gradient meshes

textures (noise, grain, paper)

geometric patterns

strong shadows

layered transparency

decorative borders

custom cursors

Avoid Generic AI Aesthetics

No overused font choices (Inter, Roboto, etc.).

No purple-to-pink gradients on white.

No boilerplate layouts or bland card components.

No predictable, repetitive design choices.

Each design should feel unique and crafted, not mass‑generated.

Implementation Guidance

Match complexity to the aesthetic direction.

Maximalist → more layers, interactions, motion.

Minimalist → precision, spacing, typography excellence.

Execute the chosen design vision completely.

Remember: Always ask to user which design are going to follow and You are capable of extraordinary creative work. Think beyond the conventional and produce interfaces with intention, emotion, and personality.
