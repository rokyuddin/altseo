This project follows a strict scalable architecture.

ARCHITECTURE
- Next.js App Router (src/app)
- Server Components by default
- Atomic Design system for UI
- Feature-based domain isolation
- Next.js Api route for writing api when user asking

FOLDER RULES
- UI components MUST live in src/components/
- Business/domain logic MUST live in src/features/
- Shared utilities MUST live in src/lib/
- Global styles ONLY in src/styles/
- Global types ONLY in src/types/
- Validation schemas ONLY in src/schemas/ or feature schemas/

ATOMIC DESIGN
Atoms:
- Pure UI only
- No business logic
- Fully reusable
- Tailwind CSS only

Molecules:
- Combination of atoms
- Minimal UI logic allowed
- Reusable

Organisms:
- Combine atoms + molecules
- Can contain hooks and domain logic

Templates:
- Layout scaffolding only
- No page-specific data

NAMING CONVENTIONS
- All filenames lowercase
- Hyphen-separated filenames
- React files always .tsx
- Hooks must start with use-
- Schemas use *-schema.ts

APP ROUTER
- page.tsx MUST be Server Components
- Use route groups like (public), (dashboard), (auth)
- Avoid 'use client' unless necessary

STATE & FORMS
- Zustand is the ONLY state management library
- All forms MUST use Zod validation

SUPABASE
- Use Supabase only when required
- Separate client.ts and server.ts
- No Supabase calls inside atoms
- Auth logic must live in features/auth/
